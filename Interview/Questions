Q. What is the difference between a Deployment and a StatefulSet in Kubernetes?

Q. When should you use a StatefulSet instead of a Deployment?

Q. Can you attach a volume to a Deployment? If yes, how is it different from a StatefulSet?

Q. What could cause a StatefulSet pod to fail when rescheduled to a different availability zone?

Q. How do PV/PVC behave across zones in EKS or Kubernetes in general?

Q. What is a DaemonSet and when would you use it?

Q. If you want two pods per node (instead of one), what alternatives to DaemonSet can you use?

Q. What is a Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) and how is it useful?

Q. How do you handle certificate rotation in on-prem Kubernetes clusters?

Q. What are the challenges with scheduling pods in a multi-node, multi-AZ setup?

Q. How does the Kubernetes scheduler decide where to place pods?

Q. What happens when a StatefulSet pod cannot mount its volume after moving to another node?

üìçAdvanced Level [ Kubernetes ]
14) Describe how you would implement dynamic provisioning of persistent storage for stateful applications.
